# robocop 0.1.0 (development version)

* Add `file_open()` to open a file locally, for example, a PPTX file, using the default system application.
* Add patched version of `officer::plot_layout_properties()`. There is a [PR pending](https://github.com/davidgohel/officer/pull/580). 
  This version, however, additionally plots the placeholder's shape id into its upper right corner.
* Added `NEWS.md`, MIT license file
